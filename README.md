## Introduction:
OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) is a vital tool for gathering information from publicly available sources to support various endeavors. This README file highlights the significance of OSINT for high-value personnel, its application during Capture the Flag (CTF) events to find criminals and missing people, and its role in aiding humanitarian missions and disaster relief efforts. Additionally, it provides a curated list of useful Linux OSINT tools with accompanying emojis.

## OSINT for High-Value Personnel: (Offensive Security)
OSINT is crucial for high-value individuals as it enables them to proactively monitor and assess potential risks to their safety and security. By leveraging open-source information, individuals can gather valuable insights about their surroundings, identify potential threats, and make informed decisions to mitigate risks.

## OSINT in Capture the Flag Events: (The Game)
During Capture the Flag events, OSINT plays a vital role in finding criminals and missing persons. By crowdsourcing OSINT efforts, participants can collaborate to gather publicly available information about the target individuals, such as social media profiles, online activities, or recent sightings. This collective intelligence helps create a comprehensive picture, aiding in the successful location and recovery of targets.

## Google Dorking and OSINT:
Google Dorking is a technique that involves using advanced search operators and specific search queries to discover sensitive information indexed by search engines. This method is widely employed in OSINT investigations to identify vulnerable systems, exposed data, and other valuable information.

## Google Dorking Tools:

1. **Google Hacking Database (GHDB)** üîç: A comprehensive collection of Google Dorks, providing a wide range of search queries to uncover sensitive information.
   - GHDB: [https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database]

2. **GooDork** üïµÔ∏è: A command-line tool for automating Google Dorking searches, allowing users to discover exposed information efficiently.
   - GooDork: [https://github.com/k3170makan/GooDork]

3. **DorkNet** üåê: An automated tool that utilizes multiple search engines, including Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo, to perform OSINT searches using predefined dork queries.
